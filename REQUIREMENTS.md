## Requirements Document

### 1. Elicitation Techniques Used

 1. ***Interviews***
    - Conducted with patients (users) and doctors to understand their needs.
    - **Summary of Findings:**
      - Patients want continuous monitoring of vital signs and real-time access to their health data.  
      - Doctors need accurate, specific, and historical data to monitor patients remotely.  
      - Both groups emphasized data privacy, system reliability, and ease of use.  
      - Users want their health data to be displayed as charts and ro recieve summary reports.
      - Doctors highlighted the importance of timely alerts and AI-assisted analysis.  

 2. ***Brainstorming Sessions***
    - Conducted with all team members to identify all possible features and system functions that aligns with the       user's needs.
    - **Summary of Findings:**
      - Integration of IoT devices for automated data collection.  
      - AI algorithms for anomaly detection and health predictions.  
      - A shared dashboard with role-based access (Patient, Doctor, Admin).  
      - Secure cloud storage and backup for all health data.  
      - Cross-platform accessibility (web and mobile).  



### 2. Raw Requirements List

The following requirements were collected through team brainstorming sessions and interviews. They represent      the initial, unfiltered expectations and needs for the system.
